## Download / How to use it?

### Method 1 - PowerShell (Windows 8 and later) ❤️

1.   Open PowerShell (Not CMD). To do that, right-click on the Windows start menu and select PowerShell or Terminal.
2.   Copy and paste the code below and press enter  
```
irm https://get.activated.win | iex
```
or (deprecated, will be retired on Dec 31 2024, use above instead)  
```
irm https://massgrave.dev/get | iex
```
3.   You will see the activation options. Choose [1] HWID for Windows activation. Choose [2] Ohook for Office activation.
4.   That's all.

- On older Windows builds you may need to run the below command before,  
`[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol=[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12`  
- The Powershell method does not work on Windows 7. Use the Method 2 - Traditional instead.  
- The URL get.activated.win may be blocked by some DNS services because it is a new domain.

### Method 2 - Traditional (Windows 7 and later)

1.   Download the file under the code button from [GitHub](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/WindowsAddict/microsoft-activation-scripts) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts)
2.   Right-click on the downloaded zip file and extract
3.   In the extracted folder, find the folder named `All-In-One-Version`
4.   Run the file named `MAS_AIO.cmd`
5.   You will see the activation options, follow the on-screen instructions.
6.   That's all.
