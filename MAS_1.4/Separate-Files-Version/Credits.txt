   Microsoft Activation Scripts (MAS):

   A collection of scripts for activating Microsoft products using HWID / KMS38 / Online KMS 
   activation methods with a focus on open-source code, less antivirus detection and user-friendliness.

   These scripts are mostly a fork of other honourable developer's tools and scripts.
